    <div id="content">

      <p>
        I was born in Belarus (then part of the Soviet Union), and spent my childhood in Israel.
        It was a wild ride, but I am now fluent in three languages, and have experienced three
        distinct cultures first-hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I studied computer science at 
        <a href="http://www.yorku.ca" target="_blank">York University</a> in Toronto,
        receiving my BSc in 2008.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Canada, I worked as a software engineer, developing Linux device drivers for line scan 
        inspection systems (special purpose scanners used to detect defects in glass used for LCD monitors).
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2008, while researching my family history, I came across 
        <a href="http://www.geni.com" target="_blank">Geni.com</a>, a social genealogy website that allowed users
        to create family trees, and share them with their families. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I saw Geni as a storytelling tool that effectively leveraged the kinship graph to illustrate 
        family histories. However, the site lacked several elements necessary to tell a complete story.
        I identified Timelines and Locations as the primary missing features.
      </p>
      <p>
        I joined their user forums and submitted proposals for several enhancements, 
        along with rough mockups. Within a few days, I received an email from the company asking for me
        to join them in their LA office. In a week I found myself at the beginning of a career that
        linked my technical, artistic, and cultural knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        In LA, I worked closely with David O. Sacks, Geni's CEO, and formerly the COO of 
        <a href="https://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank">Paypal</a> and the producer of the film 
        <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427944/" target="_blank">Thank You For Smoking</a>.
        I then became the lead designer for David's new company, 
        <a href="http://www.yammer.com" target="_blank">Yammer</a>.
        The idea was to build a tool to connect employee communities within large companies 
        in the same way that Geni connected families, Facebook connected friends, and Linkedin connected 
        employers and job-seekers. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Yammer launched in September 2008, live on stage at TechCrunch 50, and won the best-in-show award.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shortly after launching, the company relocated to San Francisco, and rapidly expanded to nearly 
        200 employees. The product also met our expectations, and is now used at over 100,000 companies
        worldwide.
