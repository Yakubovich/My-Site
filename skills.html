        <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
	Capture and analyze relevant flows from other products.
	Inspiration can often be found outside of your space.

      </li>
      <li class="step-discussion">
	<h3>DISCUSSION</h3>
	Get the team together and look over relevant materials from other products. 
	Get some ideas on a whiteboard. What works and what doesn't?

      </li>
      <li class="step-mocks">
	<h3>MOCKS</h3>
        Based on what was discussed, create a series of rough mockups. 
	This can be done with pen and paper, but I prefer Omnigraffle: 
	it's faster, and can used as a starting point for pixel-perfect mockups.
        <br/><br/> 
        I also use Omnigraffle for the final set of mockups. 
	This allows quicker iteration than Photoshop, and gives me the option of 
	creating clickable, pixel-perfect mocks when they are necessary.

	<h3>ASSETS</h3>
	Graphics, icons, buttons, etc.
        <br/> <br/> <img src="arrow.png">
      </li>
      <li class="step-code">
	<h3>CODE</h3>
	I don't usually end up writing the code 
	(front end engineers are faster and better at it) 
	but when I do, it's clean, readable, and cross-browser compatible.

      <li class="step-user-test">
	<h3>USER TEST</h3>
	This is inexpensive, and takes a couple of days. 
	Post a craigslist ad, seat some users in front of your product, 
	and have them explain their thoughts as they interact with it.
        <br/> <br/> <img src="arrow.png">
      </li>
      <li class="step-ab-test">
	<h3>A/B TEST</h3>
	Divide users into a control group, and one or more treatment groups.
	Show each group a variation of the feature, measure  the results.
	In interpreting the A/B test's results, referring to the results of 
	the user tests is often helpful.
