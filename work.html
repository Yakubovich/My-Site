      <p>
        Yammer is a social network for internal enterprise collaboration. 
        Basically, an internal Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a member of the founding team, I saw the product grow from a concept to a powerful
        tool used by 100,000 business worldwide, and the team grow from a handful of
        engineers to 150 employees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early on, I was in charge of product management, visual design, user experience / 
        interaction design, and some of the implementation (HTML/CSS). As the team expanded, 
        I came to specialize in user experience, leaving the coding to more experienced developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was the lead designer for the Yammer website, AIR desktop app, and iPhone/Blackberry apps.
      </p>

      <p>
        The above images are a small sample of the deliverables that I created while working for
        Yammer, including mockups, A/B test specifications, and user flow diagrams.

         Everyone's related, but we don't always know how.</p>

       <p>
         Geni helps people rediscover those lost connections, and share family stories through 
         collaborative family trees, photos, timelines, maps, etc.
       </p>
       <p>
         I joined the Geni team in 2007 and helped in the conception, design, and implementation of
         new features like Timelines, Places, Tree Printing, and Tree Merging.

     <h3>Educ8: tutor network (under development)</h3>
       <img src="images/work-educ8.jpg">
       <p>
         A non-profit web application to enable tutors to advertise their services, and for students 
	 and parents to find tutors by location, qualifications, and keywords.
       </p>
       <p>
         The site is set to launch this summer.
       </p>

     <h3>Savvy Survey: facebook app</h3>
       <img src="images/work-savvy.jpg">
       <p>
         I designed and developed this small Facebook app in 2008, as a side project.
       </p>
         It was inspired by existing user behavior: many of my female college friends used the 
	 Notes application on Facebook to create and share surveys like "Which superhero are you?"
	 or "Things you love".
       </p>
       <p>
         The application - written in PHP - allowed users to do the same thing, but with a friendlier
	 user interface.
